- 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS 
- BEM

### Useful resources

- [Great Resource for Flexbox](https://yoksel.github.io/flex-cheatsheet/#section-display) - Helped me review Flexbox topics
- [Image Hover](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18361924/how-to-display-image-over-image-on-hover-with-css) - Using multiple pseudo classes is a way easier way to implement hovering rather than absolute positioning divs. Just work off one.
