### My process
- Did most of my CSS with SASS, to incorporate variables and nesting. Should’ve done inheriting too.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- SASS
- BEM
### Useful resources
- Great Resource for Flexbox - Helped me review Flexbox topics
- Image Hover - Using multiple pseudo classes is a way easier way to implement hovering rather than absolute positioning divs. Just work off one.
